In place of the default 7777 port that EOS uses to run dedicated servers, we have methods to use different ports because usually what happens is that a single machine can run multiple dedicated server but if we use default method, we can only use a single port or to be precise, a single session on a single server. But with EIK, you can use multiple sessions on a single machine.","Let's see the outline of how this process works. We will assume we have a VM (Virtual Machine) where we run our servers. So whenever we start the Server.exe, UE will check which port is free to start the server on, like the first server will start on Port 7777, then the next one will start on Port 7778 and so on. Now, when EOS is informed of this server, the Port Info is passed too, thus allowing EOS to pass the updated information to all clients and making the clients join the correct server."]},{"l":"Configuration for Server","p":["The DefaultEngine.ini needs to be modified for the NetDriver settings for the server."]},{"l":"Artifact Settings","p":["Go to DevPortal, then select your organization and then go to your product page.
